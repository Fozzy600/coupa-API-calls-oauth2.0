# coupa-API-calls-oauth2.0

My work on obtaining bearer token and then using that token to make updates to Coupa objects

Coupa is moving to OAUTH2.0, initially I worked in Postman to see how this worked, now I have some python scripts that i'm going to develop into a GUI based program for my colleagues to use to fix Coupa Invoices and PO's.
